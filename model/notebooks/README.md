# Notebooks

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory analysis and data processing. Individual location directories (e.g. `/cle`, `/hou`) each correspond to a geography with an existing BRT system i.e. Cleveland's Healthline and Houston METRORapid Silver Line respectively. Each location directory contains the following notebooks, corresponding to the relevant data for the ZIP codes near that BRT system:
- `income.ipynb`: median household income
- `population.ipynb`: population and median age
- `household.ipynb`: household type (e.g. married, single)
- `car.ipynb`: car ownership
- `business.ipynb`: number of business establishments

`exploratory_analysis.ipynb` is a rough first cut at examining data manually downloaded from various sources.
