# Notebooks

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory analysis and data processing. 
- `cleveland.ipynb` contains several functions and manual edits to retrieve data surrounding Cleveland's Healthline
- `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` is a rough first cut at examining data manually downloaded from various sources.

Learnings from these notebooks influenced the `.py` files found in `/src/data`.
