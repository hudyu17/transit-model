# Notebooks

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory analysis and data processing. Individual notebooks (e.g. `cleveland.ipynb`) correspond to a geography with an existing BRT system i.e. Cleveland's Healthline. Each notebook contains the following data for the ZIP codes near that BRT system:
- Median household income
- Population and median age
- Household type (e.g. married, single)
- Car ownership
- Number of business establishments

`exploratory_analysis.ipynb` is a rough first cut at examining data manually downloaded from various sources.
